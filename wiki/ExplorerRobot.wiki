= Navigation =

The robot uses leJOS and the classes in [http://lejos.sourceforge.net/nxt/nxj/api/lejos/robotics/navigation/package-summary.html lejos.robotics.navigation] to navigate and to determine the current (relative) position.
As for now we are using [http://lejos.sourceforge.net/nxt/nxj/api/lejos/robotics/navigation/TachoPilot.html TachoPilot], but we plan to use the [http://lejos.sourceforge.net/nxt/nxj/api/lejos/robotics/navigation/CompassPilot.html CompassPilot].

= Construction =

== Design ==

The robot is based on the design of the [Explorer http://www.nxtprograms.com/explorer/index.html] from [NXTPrograms.com http://www.nxtprograms.com/]. We've modified it to be more stable and to support more sensors etc.

== Sensors ==

We use some sensors to collect data with the robot.
They are listed below.

== Distance ==
